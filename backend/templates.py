Ensure full responsiveness by adjusting text sizes (H1: 48px, H2: 28px, P: 16px) on tablets (768px) and using a single-column layout with a collapsible hamburger menu on mobile (375px). The website should be implemented in React using modular components (e.g. `Navbar.js`, `HeroSection.js`, `Welcome.js`, `Events.js`, `News.js`, `Footer.js`, change these on the basis of website title), leveraging flexbox and grid layouts, smooth hover animations, and ensuring accessibility compliance.
